# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think adding a list for breakfasat items could help fill up the menu section. We could even add a list for the local coffee beans sold by the pound.

Adding a logo to the menu section with a coffee mug that is animated could help bring the menu section alive
Add your ideas here :)
